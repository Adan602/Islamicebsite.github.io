                    Sultan Ahmed Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque, is an Ottoman-era historical imperial mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. A functioning mosque, it also attracts large numbers of tourist visitors. It was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the
                    rule of Ahmed I. Its Külliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque’s interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque’s five main domes, six minarets
                    and eight secondary domes.It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, the principal mosque of Istanbul until the Blue Mosque's construction and another popular tourist site. The Blue Mosque was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list
                    in 1985 under the name of "Historic Areas of Istanbul".

                    Masjid al-Haram , also known as the Great Mosque of Mecca,[6] is a mosque that surrounds the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able,
                    and is also the main phase for the ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important
                    significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa. As of August 2020, the Great Mosque is the largest mosque and the eighth largest building in the world. The Great Mosque
                    has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years. It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the
                    Two Holy Mosques.

                    Al-Masjid an-Nabawi , known in English as The Prophet's Mosque, and also known as Al Haram, Al Haram Al Madani and Al Haram Al Nabawi by locals, is a mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi
                    Arabia. It was the second mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, after Masjid Quba'a, and is now one of the largest mosques in the world. It is the second holiest site in Islam, after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. The land of Al-Masjid
                    an-Nabawi belonged to two young orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, and when they came to know that Muhammad wished to acquire their land for the purposes of erecting a mosque, they went to Muhammad and offered the land to him as a gift; Muhammad
                    insisted on paying a price for the land because they were orphaned children. The price agreed upon was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, who thus became the endower or donor of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi on behalf of, or in favor of, Muhammad.al-Ansari
                    also accommodated Muhammad upon his arrival at Madinah in 622. Muhammad shared in the construction of the mosque. Originally an open-air building, the mosque served as a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. There
                    was a raised platform or pulpit (mimbar) for the people who taught the Quran and for Muhammad to give the Friday sermon (khutbah). Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated the mosque, naming its walls, doors and minarets
                    after themselves and their forefathers. After an expansion during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I, it now incorporates the final resting place of Muhammad and the first two Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar. One of the
                    most notable features of the site is the Green Dome in the south-east corner of the mosque, originally Aisha's house, where the tomb of Muhammad is located. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj also go to Madinah to visit (Ziyarah) the
                    Green Dome. In 1909, under the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. The mosque is under the control of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
                    The mosque is located at the heart of Madinah and is a major pilgrimage site.<br><br> <b>ALLAH HU AKBAR</b>

                    it was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656, and inaugurated by its first Imam, Syed Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari. Situated in the Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad (today Old Delhi), it served as the imperial mosque of the Mughal
                    emperors until the demise of the empire in 1857. The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic node of Islamic power across India, well into the colonial era. It was also a site of political significance during several key periods of
                    British rule. It remains in active use, and is one of Delhi's most iconic sites, closely identified with the ethos of Old Delhi.
                    <br> The mosque has two names. The older one, bestowed by Shah Jahan, is 'Masjid-i-Jehān-Numā', roughly translating to "mosque commanding the view of the world" in Persian and Urdu. The other more common one is 'Jama Masjid', which
                    emerged among the common populace. Its literal translation in Arabic is "congregational mosque". It is used in the sense of 'Friday mosque' (Juma Masjid), since this is when the congregational prayer is held. The term 'Jama Masjid'
                    is not unique to Delhi's mosque; since the 7th century, it has been used in the Islamic world to denote the community mosque, and hence many around the world bear this name and its variants.

                    Makkah Masjid or Mecca Masjid, is a congregational mosque in Hyderabad, India. It is one of the largest mosques in India with a capacity of 10,000 people.The mosque was built during the 17th century, and is a state-protected monument. It serves as the
                    primary mosque for the Old City of Hyderabad,and is located close to the historic landmarks of Charminar, Chowmahalla Palace and Laad Bazaar.Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to
                    be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, thus giving the mosque its name.<br><br> The construction of the Makkah Masjid
                    began in the year 1617 CE, during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth Qutb Shahi Sultan of Golconda (now Hyderabad). The ruler personally laid its foundation stone. Around 8,000 workers were employed to build the mosque.
                    It was completed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1693.The three arched facades have been carved from a single piece of granite, which took five years to quarry. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a French explorer, in his travelogue observed:
                    "It is about 50 years since they began to build a splendid pagoda in the town which will be the grandest in all India when it is completed. The size of the stone is the subject of special accomplishment, and that of a niche, which
                    is its place for prayer, is an entire rock of such enormous size that they spent five years in quarrying it, and 500 to 600 men were employed continually on its work. It required still more time to roll it up on to conveyance by which
                    they brought it to the pagoda; and they took 1400 oxen to draw it."<br><br> The Mecca Masjid is considered to be one of the best architectural works of the Qutb Shahis.It is constructed entirely of dressed stone, rather than rubble
                    or plaster. The mosque's prayer hall measures 225 feet (69 m) by 180 feet (55 m), and has a 75 feet (23 m) high ceiling. The facade of the prayer hall features five open arches, and is flanked by two minarets. Each minaret is topped
                    by a dome, and adjoined to an arcaded balcony lining either side of the prayer hall. The sahn (courtyard) of the mosque measures 108 square metres.It contains a sundial, as well as the remains of a hammam. Two minarets lie on either
                    side of the main entrance to the mosque complex. Towards the southern end of the mosque lie the marble tombs of the Asaf Jahi rulers and family members, save the first (Asaf Jah I) and the last (Asaf Jah VII). These are housed in a
                    rectangular, arched, and canopied building, which was added in 1914 during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Asaf Jahi ruler.At both ends of this resting place for the Asaf Jahi's are two rectangular blocks with four minarets
                    each. These minarets have elegant and circular balconies with low ornamental walls and arches. Above them is an octagonal inverted platter from which the rest of the minarets soar until arrested by a dome and a spire.<br>

                            Muhammad was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of the world religion of Islam.According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Hazrat Adam (as),hazrat
                            Ibrahim (as) , Hazrat Isa (as) ,Hazrat musa (as), and other prophets.He is believed to be the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief. Muhammad united
                            Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE (Year of the Elephant) in Mecca. He was the son
                            of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and Abdullah died a few months before Muhammad's birth. His mother Amina died when he was six,
                            leaving Muhammad an orphan.He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights
                            of prayer. When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by 'jibraeel' (as) in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly,proclaiming that "God is One"
                            ("LA ILA HA ILL ALLAH "), that complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way of life , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam. Muhammad's followers were initially few
                            in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists for 13 years. To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known
                            as Yathrib) later in 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after
                            eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed.
                            In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam. The revelations that Muhammad reported receiving until
                            his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" on which the religion is based.

                            Ali ibn Abi Talib was a cousin, son-in-law and companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He ruled as the fourth Rightly Guided caliph from 656 until his assassination in 661 and is one of the central figures in Shia Islam, being regarded as the rightful
                            immediate successor to Muhammad and the first Imam by all branches of Shia Muslims.He is the son of Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad, the husband of Fatimah al-Zahra, and the father of Hasan, Husayn and Zaynab. As a child, due
                            to his father's debt, Mohammad took care of him. After Muhammad's invitation of his close relatives, Ali became one of the first believers in Islam at the age of about 9 to 11.He then publicly accepted his invitation on Yawm
                            al-Inzar and Muhammad called him his brother, guardian and successor.It is said that he helped Muhammad emigrate on the night of Laylat al-Mabit.Then Muhammad, after migrating to Medina and establishing a brotherhood pact between
                            the Muslims, chose him as his brother.In Medina, he was the flag bearer in most of the wars and became famous for his bravery. The issue of his right in the post-Muhammad caliphate caused a major rift between Muslims and caused
                            their division into Shia and Sunni groups.On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage, at Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad uttered the phrase, "Whoever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla." But the meaning of Mawla was disputed by Shias
                            and Sunnis. On this basis, the Shias believe in the establishment of the Imamate and caliphate regarding Ali, and the Sunnis interpret the word as friendship and love.While Ali was preparing Muhammad's body for burial and performing
                            his funeral rites, a group of Muslims met at Saqifah and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr.Ali initially refused to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr; But finally, after six months, he pledged allegiance to him. Ali did not take part
                            in the wars during the caliphate of the first three caliphsand had no political activity except for the election of the third caliph. But, he advised the three caliphs whenever they wanted, in religious, judicial, and political
                            matters. After Uthman was killed, he was elected the fourth caliph of the Muslims. His caliphate coincided with the first civil wars between Muslims. Ali faced two separate opposition forces: a group led by Aisha, Talhah, and
                            Zubayr in Mecca, who wanted to convene a council to determine the caliphate. And another group led by Muawiyah in the Levant who demanded revenge for Uthman's blood. Four months after his caliphate, Ali defeated the first group
                            in Battle of the Camel; But in the end, Battle of Siffin with Muawiyah was militarily ineffective, and led to an arbitration which ended politically against Ali. Then, in the year 38 AH, he fought with the Kharijites - who
                            considered Ali's acceptance of arbitration as heresy, and revolted against him - in Nahrawan and defeated them. Ali was eventually killed in the mosque of Kufa by the sword of one of the Kharijites, Ibn Muljam Moradi, and was
                            buried outside the city of Kufa. Later his shrine and the city of Najaf were built around his tomb. Despite the impact of religious differences on Muslim historiography, sources agree that Ali was a deeply religious figure
                            devoted to Islam and a just ruler in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. He strictly observed religious duties and avoided worldly possessions. Some writers accused him of lack of political skill and flexibility. According
                            to Wilferd Madelung, his refusal to participate in the new game of political deception and clever opportunism that had taken root during his caliphate in the Islamic State, although depriving him of success in life, but, in
                            the eyes of his admirers, he became an example of the piety of the primary un-corrupted Islam, as well as the chivalry of pre-Islamic Arabia. Many of Ali's short speeches have become part of Islamic public culture, and Arabic-language
                            writers have referred to Ali's unparalleled eloquence and sermons.Several books are dedicated to the hadiths, sermons, and prayers narrated by him, the most famous of which is Nahj al-Balagha. Numerous poems and writings in
                            different languages in praise of Ali's position are also part of the literature and religious culture of Muslim nations.

                            Khalid ibn al-Walid ibn al-Mughira al-Makhzumi was an Arab Muslim commander in the service of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar who played a leading role in the Ridda wars against rebel tribes in Arabia in 632–633 and the
                            early Muslim conquests of Sasanian Iraq in 633–634 and Byzantine Syria in 634–638. A horseman of the Quraysh tribe's aristocratic Makhzum clan, which ardently opposed Muhammad, Khalid played the instrumental role in defeating
                            the Muslims at the Battle of Uhud in 625. Following his conversion to Islam in 627 or 629, he was made a commander by Muhammad, who bestowed on him the title Sayf Allah (the Sword of God). Khalid coordinated the safe withdrawal
                            of Muslim troops during the abortive expedition to Mu'ta against the Arab allies of the Byzantines in 629 and led the Bedouin contingents of the Muslim army during the capture of Mecca and the Battle of Hunayn in c. 630. After
                            Muhammad's death, Khalid was appointed to suppress or subjugate Arab tribes in Najd and the Yamama opposed to the nascent Muslim state, defeating the rebel leaders Tulayha at the Battle of Buzakha in 632 and Musaylima at the
                            Battle of Aqraba in 633. Khalid subsequently moved against the largely Christian Arab tribes and the Sasanian Persian garrisons of the Euphrates valley in Iraq. He was reassigned by Abu Bakr to command the Muslim armies in
                            Syria and he led his men there on an unconventional march across a long, waterless stretch of the Syrian Desert, boosting his reputation as a military strategist. As a result of decisive victories against the Byzantines at
                            Ajnadayn (634), Fahl (634), Damascus (634–635) and Yarmouk (636), the Muslims under Khalid conquered much of Syria. He was afterward demoted from the high command by Umar for a range of causes cited by traditional Islamic and
                            modern sources. Khalid continued service as the key lieutenant of his successor Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah in the sieges of Homs and Aleppo and the Battle of Qinnasrin, all in 637–638, which collectively precipitated the retreat
                            from Syria of imperial Byzantine troops under Emperor Heraclius. Umar dismissed Khalid from his governorship of Qinnasrin afterward and he died in Medina or Homs in 642. Khalid is generally considered by historians to be one
                            of early Islam's most seasoned and accomplished generals and he is commemorated throughout the Arab world until the present day. The Islamic tradition credits Khalid for his battlefield tactics and effective leadership of the
                            early Muslim conquests, but accuses him of illicitly executing Arab tribesmen who had accepted Islam, namely members of the Banu Jadhima during the lifetime of Muhammad and Malik ibn Nuwayra during the Ridda wars, and moral
                            and fiscal misconduct in Syria. His military fame disturbed some of the pious, early Muslim converts, including Umar, who feared it could develop into a personality cult.

                            Al-Nasir Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, better known simply as Salah ad-Din or Saladin, the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height
                            of his power, his sultanate spanned Egypt, Syria, the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the Hejaz (western Arabia), Yemen, parts of western North Africa, and Nubia. He was originally sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164 alongside his uncle
                            Shirkuh, a general of the Zengid army, on the orders of their lord Nur ad-Din to help restore Shawar as vizier of the teenage Fatimid caliph al-Adid. A power struggle ensued between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated.
                            Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults against its territory and his personal closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh
                            died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a Sunni Muslim to such an important position in the Shia caliphate. During his tenure as vizier, Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and,
                            following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the Fatimid Caliphate and realigned the country's allegiance with the Sunni, Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate. In the following years, he led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine,
                            commissioned the successful conquest of Yemen, and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in Upper Egypt. Not long after Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Saladin launched his conquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request
                            of its governor. By mid-1175, Saladin had conquered Hama and Homs, inviting the animosity of other Zengid lords, the official rulers of Syria's various regions. Soon after, he defeated the Zengid army at the Battle of the Horns
                            of Hama of 1175 and was thereafter proclaimed the "Sultan of Egypt and Syria" by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi. Saladin made further conquests in northern Syria and the Jazira, escaping two attempts on his life by Assassins,
                            before returning to Egypt in 1177 to address issues there. By 1182, Saladin had completed the conquest of Muslim Syria after capturing Aleppo, but ultimately failed to take over the Zengid stronghold of Mosul. Under Saladin's
                            command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, and thereafter wrested control of Palestine—including the city of Jerusalem—from the Crusaders, who had conquered the area 88 years
                            earlier. Although the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem continued to exist until the late 13th century, its defeat at Hattin marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim powers of the region. Saladin died in Damascus
                            in 1193, having given away much of his personal wealth to his subjects. He is buried in a mausoleum adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque. Saladin has become a prominent figure in Muslim, Arab, Turkish and Kurdish culture, and has
                            been described as the most famous Kurd in history.
